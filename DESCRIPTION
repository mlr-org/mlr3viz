Description: Provides visualizations for 'mlr3' objects such as
    tasks, predictions, resample results or benchmark results via the
    autoplot() generic of 'ggplot2'. The returned 'ggplot' objects are
    intended to provide sensible defaults, yet can easily be customized to
    create camera-ready figures. Visualizations include barplots,
    boxplots, histograms, ROC curves, and Precision-Recall curves.
